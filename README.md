## Destabilizing buoyancy flux

Setups:

1. With a constant, destabilizing buoyancy flux:
- Initial linear stratification
- Initial mixed layer + linear stratification below

2. With a daily cycle of destabilizing buoyancy flux:
- With no internal heating during the day (convection shutoff)
- With internal heating during the day (shallow restratification)
